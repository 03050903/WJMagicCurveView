# WJMagicCurveView
By simply setting several parameters, You'll get a fancy magic curve immediately.

# Let's see what it is

# How it works
By setting eight parameters, WJMagicCurveView will draw a beautiful curve based on a math function.

First, we'll create two points and make them rotate in specified speed and specified radius revolving a same center;
Second, whenever they reach a point during rotating, we'll draw a line connecting these two points;
Thirds, continue rotate and draw lines, Bingo! You're creating a new beautiful curve!

# How to create your own curve
We provide eight base parameters for normal users and more for developers from code level. Here are explaintion for these parameters:

1. radiusAX、radiusAY:  A point is the outer rotating point, these two are the radius of A;
2. radiusBX、radiusBY:  B point is the inner rotating point;
3. speedOuterPoint、speedInnerPoint: the rotating speed for A & B;
4. loopTotalCount: the loop count for these two rotating points;
5. durationSeconds: the durationg speed for rotating.
